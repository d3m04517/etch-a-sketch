## DOM Manipulation Project
This project was created using DOM Manipulation using Javascript. DOM Manipulation is the interaction of the Javascript DOM API. It allows you to modify elements in your HTML document without needing a refresh. 

## What does this application do?
This application allows you to hover over tiles in a 16x16 grid to create a sketch. When your mouse passes over tiles, the color of the tiles will change, leaving a pixelated trail of colors (like a pen).
